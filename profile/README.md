# Welcome!
This is the official open-source version of SafeMoon's Mooncraft project. 
Mooncraft is a combination of different game modes for the community built within Minecraft.
This repository contains all the configured servers that were running on the Mooncraft network.

We realized so many people have put their time and heart into Mooncraft. Many people have ideas of their own on how they want to play, or what they have always wanted to change. We want to give everyone the ability to create these experiences separately since we have decided to wind down the project from our end!

## Open Source
Everything seen on the Mooncraft network is now open-source. Any plugin jars that were not made exclusively by us, we cannot directly distribute. However, we have left ALL our configuration files present so our settings & alterations can be used. These plugins can be found on SpigotMC or MCMarket marketplaces. All of the code for our custom plugins are available within these repositories. However, for our internally coded solutions, you will need to edit some code to fit your needs, and then compile the jars yourself. Since build scripts were using internal and private infrastructure, things may not compile as expected out of the box. Also, attention must be oriented **only** towards the pinned repositories, any other repository may be incomplete or obsolete: in other words, were unused.


## Disclaimer
Do not contact SafeMoon or repositories contributors for any help because no customer support will be provided.
